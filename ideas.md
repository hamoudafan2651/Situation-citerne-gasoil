  **Design Movement**: Industrial Brutalism meets Modern Dashboard
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Emphasize data clarity and operational efficiency.
  2. **High Contrast**: Use strong contrasts to guide attention in bright outdoor environments (typical for field work).
  3. **Modular Grid**: Strict, visible grid lines to reflect the structured nature of the log sheet.
  4. **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and inputs should feel "heavy" and substantial, like physical switches.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Safety Orange (#FF6700) - Represents caution, visibility, and industrial context.
  - **Secondary**: Slate Grey (#2C3E50) - Represents steel, oil, and machinery.
  - **Background**: Off-white/Concrete (#F5F5F5) for daylight readability.
  - **Intent**: To create a tool that feels like a piece of reliable equipment, not just a website.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Dashboard-First**: Sidebar navigation for quick access to logs, analytics, and settings.
  - **Card-Based Data Entry**: Instead of a giant table, use focused cards for each entry to reduce errors on mobile.
  - **Split View**: Desktop view shows the list on the left and details/editing on the right.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Monospace Typography for Data**: Use a monospaced font for all numbers and codes (e.g., tank numbers, quantities).
  - **Thick Borders**: 2px-3px borders on active elements.
  - **Status Indicators**: Traffic light colors (Green/Yellow/Red) for tank status or validation.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Immediate Validation**: Inputs turn green/red instantly upon typing.
  - **Swipe Actions**: On mobile, swipe list items to edit or delete.
  - **Confirmations**: Critical actions (like deleting a log) require a "hold to confirm" interaction.

  **Animation**:
  - **Mechanical Transitions**: Slide-ins and pop-ups should be snappy (0.2s) with no bounce.
  - **Loading States**: A filling tank animation instead of a spinner.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Chakra Petch' or 'Rajdhani' (Square, technical sans-serif).
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto' for readability.
  - **Data**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Roboto Mono'.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Clean Corporate
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency & Depth**: Use frosted glass effects to layer information.
  2. **Soft Shadows**: Floating elements to create hierarchy.
  3. **Fluid Layout**: Content flows naturally, adapting to screen size without rigid grids.
  4. **Approachable Professionalism**: Clean, friendly, but authoritative.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Ocean Blue (#005F73) - Trust, stability, corporate identity.
  - **Secondary**: Teal/Cyan (#0A9396) - Freshness, energy (fuel).
  - **Background**: Subtle gradient or abstract geometric pattern.
  - **Intent**: To modernize the paperwork process, making it feel like a high-tech enterprise solution.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Focus**: Login and main actions centered on screen.
  - **Floating Cards**: Data tables and forms float above the background.
  - **Top Navigation**: Clean top bar for user profile and main sections.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass Cards**: Background blur on containers.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Large border-radius (16px+) for a friendly feel.
  - **Gradient Buttons**: Subtle gradients on primary actions.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Flow**: Transitions are gentle and fluid (0.4s ease-out).
  - **Hover Lifts**: Elements rise slightly when hovered.
  - **Ripple Effects**: Clicks generate a subtle ripple.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Scale**: Elements fade in and scale up slightly.
  - **Parallax**: Subtle background movement on scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Poppins' (Geometric, friendly sans-serif).
  - **Body**: 'Open Sans' or 'Lato'.
  - **Data**: 'Fira Code' for tabular data.

  **Design Movement**: Neomorphism / Soft UI
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Soft Plasticity**: Elements appear to be extruded from the background.
  2. **Minimal Color**: Heavy reliance on light and shadow to define shapes.
  3. **Tactile Realism**: Buttons look like they can be physically pressed.
  4. **Unified Surface**: Everything feels like it's made of the same material.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Light Grey-Blue (#E0E5EC).
  - **Highlights**: White (#FFFFFF).
  - **Shadows**: Darker Grey-Blue (#A3B1C6).
  - **Accents**: Vivid Blue (#007AFF) for active states only.
  - **Intent**: To reduce visual clutter and focus entirely on the interaction and data.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single Surface**: The app feels like one continuous surface with indentations and extrusions.
  - **Inset Inputs**: Form fields look like they are pressed into the screen.
  - **Extruded Buttons**: Actions pop out.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Complex double shadows (light top-left, dark bottom-right).
  - **Monochrome Palette**: Very few colors, mostly shades of the base color.
  - **Circular Indicators**: Round progress bars and status lights.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Press Mechanics**: Buttons visually depress when clicked.
  - **Toggle Switches**: Realistic sliding switches.
  - **Haptic Visuals**: Visual feedback mimics physical touch.

  **Animation**:
  - **State Morphs**: Smooth morphing between shapes.
  - **Slow Ease**: Relaxed, natural motion.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Nunito' (Rounded sans-serif).
  - **Body**: 'Quicksand' or 'Varela Round'.
  - **Data**: 'Inconsolata'.
